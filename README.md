** LLM and RAG Correlation**

**Problem Statement**

LLMs trained on fixed datasets can quickly become outdated as the internet and information evolve. For example, a GPT-3 model trained in 2023 might not be able to answer questions about events in 2024.

**Solution**

One potential solution is to continuously retrain LLMs on the latest internet data. However, this can be computationally expensive.

**RAG as an Alternative**

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a promising alternative. RAG combines retrieval and generation techniques. It retrieves relevant information from a massive dataset and uses an LLM to generate a response based on the retrieved information. By constantly updating the retrieved information, RAG models can potentially stay up-to-date.

**Dependencies**

* sentence-transformers
* sklearn.metrics.pairwise
* langchain-pinecone
* langchain.embeddings
* langchain-community.embeddings
* google.colab (optional)
* pinecone
* os
* tempfile
* github
* git
* openai
* pathlib
* langchain.schema

**Installation**

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers langchain langchain-community openai tiktoken pinecone-client langchain_pinecone
```

**Basic Workflow**

1. **Data Retrieval:** Use a web scraper or API to gather relevant information from the internet.
2. **Document Creation:** Preprocess the retrieved information and create `Document` objects using `langchain.schema`.
3. **Embedding Generation:** Use `OpenAIEmbeddings` or `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` to generate embeddings for each document.
4. **Storage:** Utilize `PineconeVectorStore` to store the document embeddings in a Pinecone vector database.
5. **Query Processing:**
   * Take a user query as input.
   * Utilize retrieval techniques to find relevant documents from the Pinecone store based on the query.
   * Pass the retrieved documents to an LLM for response generation.

**Note:** This is a simplified example. The actual implementation will likely involve additional steps such as pre-processing, fine-tuning the LLM, and evaluating the retrieved information.

**Conclusion**

This project aims to investigate the potential of RAG techniques to address the limitations of LLM models trained on static datasets. By leveraging the power of retrieval and generation, RAG models can potentially offer more up-to-date and informative responses.
